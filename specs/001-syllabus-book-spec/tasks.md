# Task-Level Execution Specification: Syllabus-Driven Specification for AI/Spec-Based Technical Book

**Feature**: Syllabus-Driven Specification for AI/Spec-Based Technical Book
**Branch**: `001-syllabus-book-spec`
**Date**: 2025-12-24
**Input**: Implementation plan from `/specs/001-syllabus-book-spec/plan.md`

**Note**: This document is generated by the `/sp.tasks` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/tasks.md` for the generation workflow.

## Dependencies

- **User Stories**: P1 (Create Docusaurus Book Structure), P1 (Generate Book Content), P2 (Validate Content)
- **Order**: User stories can be developed in parallel after foundational setup
- **Blocking**: Foundational tasks must complete before user story development

## Parallel Execution Examples

- **Per Story**: Each user story can be developed independently after setup
- **Within Story**: Content generation tasks can run in parallel across different chapters
- **Cross-Cutting**: Validation and deployment tasks span all stories

## Implementation Strategy

- **MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Docusaurus structure generation) with basic content
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each user story adds complete functionality
- **Verification**: Each increment validates against constitution and spec

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create Docusaurus Book Structure from Syllabus (Priority: P1)

### Goal
Transform a syllabus into a well-structured Docusaurus-based technical book with proper chapters and navigation.

### Independent Test Criteria
Given a syllabus with multiple topics, when the system processes it, then a Docusaurus book structure with corresponding chapters and proper navigation is created.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a syllabus with multiple topics, when the system processes it, then a Docusaurus book structure with corresponding chapters and proper navigation is created
2. Given a syllabus with hierarchical topics, when the system processes it, then the book maintains the logical learning progression and hierarchy

### Tasks

- [x] T028 [US1] [P] Set chapter positions to maintain learning progression
- [x] T029 [US1] Generate navigation structure in sidebar or _category_.json
- [x] T030 [US1] Map syllabus topics to chapter files per FR-001
- [x] T031 [US1] Validate one-to-one mapping between topics and chapters per FR-002
- [x] T032 [US1] [P] Create navigation hierarchy reflecting syllabus structure
- [x] T033 [US1] [P] Test syllabus-to-book generation with sample input
- [x] T034 [US1] [P] Verify generated book structure meets Docusaurus best practices
- [x] T035 [US1] [P] Validate chapter files follow proper heading hierarchy per FR-003

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Generate Book Content Using AI Assistance (Priority: P1)

### Goal
Generate book content that strictly follows syllabus requirements using AI assistance while maintaining established book structure.

### Independent Test Criteria
Given syllabus topics, when AI generates content for them, then the content covers all required topics while maintaining quality and accuracy.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a syllabus topic, when AI generates content for it, then the content covers all aspects required by the syllabus
2. Given AI-generated content, when it's reviewed, then it maintains consistency with the overall book structure and syllabus requirements

### Tasks

- [x] T036 [US2] Integrate Claude Code for AI-assisted content generation
- [x] T037 [US2] [P] Generate content for each chapter based on syllabus topic
- [x] T038 [US2] [P] Ensure content follows syllabus learning objectives per data model
