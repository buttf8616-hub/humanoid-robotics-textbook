# Task-Level Execution Specification: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

**Feature**: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book
**Branch**: `002-physical-ai-robotics-book`
**Date**: 2025-12-24
**Input**: Implementation plan from `/specs/002-physical-ai-robotics-book/plan.md`

**Note**: This document is generated by the `/sp.tasks` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/tasks.md` for the generation workflow.

## Dependencies

- **User Stories**: P1 (Physical AI Fundamentals), P1 (ROS 2 Content), P2 (Simulation Content), P2 (NVIDIA Isaac Content), P3 (Vision-Language-Action Content)
- **Order**: User stories can be developed in parallel after foundational setup
- **Blocking**: Foundational tasks must complete before user story development

## Parallel Execution Examples

- **Per Story**: Each user story can be developed independently after setup
- **Within Story**: Content generation tasks can run in parallel across different chapters
- **Cross-Cutting**: Validation and deployment tasks span all stories

## Implementation Strategy

- **MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Physical AI fundamentals book structure) with basic ROS 2 content
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each user story adds complete functionality
- **Verification**: Each increment validates against constitution and spec
