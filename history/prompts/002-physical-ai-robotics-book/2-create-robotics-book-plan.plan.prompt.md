# Implementation Plan: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

**Branch**: `002-physical-ai-robotics-book` | **Date**: 2025-12-24 | **Spec**: specs/002-physical-ai-robotics-book/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-physical-ai-robotics-book/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create a Docusaurus-based technical book for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics using AI assistance, ensuring all content is spec-compliant and grounded in verified robotics documentation sources. The system will automatically generate book structure, chapters, and navigation based on the Physical AI syllabus modules while maintaining logical learning progression and technical accuracy validation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Node.js LTS, JavaScript/TypeScript for Docusaurus framework
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus framework, Context7 MCP for robotics documentation verification, Claude Code for AI assistance
**Storage**: File-based storage for Markdown/MDX content, Git for versioning
**Testing**: Jest for unit tests, manual validation of generated robotics content
**Target Platform**: Web-based documentation site deployable to GitHub Pages
**Project Type**: Static site generation/web documentation
**Performance Goals**: <10 minutes to generate complete book structure from syllabus
**Constraints**: Content must be verifiable against official robotics documentation sources, AI-generated content must comply with syllabus requirements and technical accuracy standards
**Scale/Scope**: Support for syllabi with up to 50 topics/chapters, maintainable documentation structure covering ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1. **Spec-First Development**: All book structure and content originates from explicit specifications - COMPLIANT
2. **AI-Assisted, Human-Directed**: Claude Code used for content generation with human oversight - COMPLIANT
3. **Source-Grounded Content**: All content must be grounded in official Docusaurus documentation and Context7 MCP - COMPLIANT
4. **Modular & Maintainable Documentation**: Following Docusaurus best practices for navigation and content structure - COMPLIANT
5. **Reproducibility & Transparency**: Any developer can clone, review specs, regenerate and deploy - COMPLIANT
6. **Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: TDD approach for all code components and book generation processes - COMPLIANT

**Structure Decision**: Single static site project using Docusaurus framework for documentation generation and deployment. This structure aligns with the technology stack requirements in the constitution (Docusaurus framework, Markdown/MDX content format) and supports the goal of creating a comprehensive Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book with proper navigation and structure.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive implementation plan for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book with all required artifacts
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and API contracts in specs/002-physical-ai-robotics-book/
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to create implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan aligns with constitution principles and provides clear technical approach for robotics book implementation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create implementation tasks based on this plan
